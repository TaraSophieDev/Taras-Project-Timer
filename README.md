# Tara's Project Timer

This Plugin tracks your project time on a project basis, like steam time tracking.

This project was made for Godot 4.2

## Disclaimer
This plugin currently saves it's project time in the ```user://``` directory, see [File Paths in Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/io/data_paths.html#accessing-persistent-user-data-user). If you work on a project on multiple devices, the timer won't transfer the time save. I'll work on a solution soon.
